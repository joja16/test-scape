## Direct Links After Publishing
- Release Page: https://github.com/joja16/test-scape/releases/tag/v1.0.0

The executable file to upload is located at:
```
D:\code\BOT\auto-scrape\dist\AutoScrape.exe
```

- Upload may take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed
- Users can download and run directly without Python installed
- The executable is not code-signed, so Windows may show security warnings
